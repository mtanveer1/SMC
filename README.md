## Datasets
-----------
The datasets and details of the datasets are given in the dataset repository.

## Running the codes  
--------------------
As a demo for the detailed experimental setup, we have included the deatiled code of the RVFL (RNN Model) and pin-GTSVM (HbC) models.
The final results can be inferred from `Model_main.m`, where Model refers to the name of the particular model. 

## Hyperparameters
------------------
The hyperparameter setting is reported in Tables 2 and 3 of the paper, and the best hyperparameters are reported in Tables 6 and 10 of the paper.

## Note
------- 
1. The codes have been cleaned for better readability. For the detailed experimental setup, please follow the paper. 
We have re-run and checked the codes only in a few datasets, so if you find any bugs or issues, please write to M. Sajid (phd2101241003@iiti.ac.in).
2. Some parts of the codes have been taken from the original papers of their respective models. If you have any conceptual queries, kindly refer to 
the original paper of the model.
3. The source codes of the algorithms and datasets are available at the GitHub repository https://github.com/mtanveer1/SMC.
